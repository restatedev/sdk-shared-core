# restate-sdk-shared-core v0.9.0 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Security**: Replaced the unmaintained `paste` crate with `pastey` to address [RUSTSEC-2024-0436](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0436.html)
- Upgraded `jsonwebtoken` to 10.3 with pure-Rust `rust_crypto` backend, removing the `ring` dependency

## Dependency Updates

### Replace `paste` with `pastey` (RUSTSEC-2024-0436)

The `paste` crate has been flagged as unmaintained ([RUSTSEC-2024-0436](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0436.html)). It has been replaced with `pastey`, a maintained fork with the same API.

### Upgrade `jsonwebtoken` 9.3 to 10.3 with `rust_crypto` Backend

The `jsonwebtoken` dependency has been upgraded from 9.3 to 10.3, switching from the `ring`-based crypto backend to the pure-Rust `rust_crypto` backend (which uses `ed25519-dalek`). This **removes the `ring` dependency entirely** from the `request_identity` feature.

No code changes required in downstream SDKs — the public API is unchanged.

### Upgrade `assert2` to 4.0

The `assert2` dev-dependency has been upgraded from 0.3.18 to 0.4.0.
