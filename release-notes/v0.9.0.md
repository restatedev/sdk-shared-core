# restate-sdk-shared-core v0.9.0 Release Notes

## Highlights

- **Security**: Replaced the unmaintained `paste` crate with `pastey` to address [RUSTSEC-2024-0436](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0436.html)
- **Portability**: Removed the `ring` native dependency by upgrading `jsonwebtoken` to 10.3 with a pure-Rust `rust_crypto` backend (ed25519-dalek), improving cross-runtime compatibility for downstream SDKs

## Dependency Updates

### Replace `paste` with `pastey` (RUSTSEC-2024-0436)

The `paste` crate has been flagged as unmaintained ([RUSTSEC-2024-0436](https://rustsec.org/advisories/RUSTSEC-2024-0436.html)). It has been replaced with `pastey`, a maintained fork with the same API.

**Impact on Downstream SDKs**: None. This is an internal macro dependency with no API changes.

### Upgrade `jsonwebtoken` 9.3 to 10.3 with `rust_crypto` Backend

The `jsonwebtoken` dependency has been upgraded from 9.3 to 10.3, switching from the `ring`-based crypto backend to the pure-Rust `rust_crypto` backend (which uses `ed25519-dalek`). This **removes the `ring` dependency entirely** from the `request_identity` feature.

#### Why This Matters

The `ring` crate requires native C compilation and has historically caused issues in certain runtimes and build environments (Deno, Bun, Vercel Edge Functions, cross-compilation targets). By switching to a pure-Rust crypto stack, downstream SDKs that enable `request_identity` no longer need to compile `ring`.

#### Impact on Downstream SDKs

- **TypeScript SDK**: Improved portability across runtimes (Deno, Bun, Vercel) where native dependencies were problematic
- **Python SDK**: Simplified build with no native crypto dependency from this crate
- **Rust SDK**: Reduced native dependency footprint; may resolve build issues on some targets
- **No code changes required**: The public API is unchanged

### Upgrade `assert2` to 4.0

The `assert2` dev-dependency has been upgraded from 0.3.18 to 0.4.0.

**Impact on Downstream SDKs**: None. This is a dev-only dependency used for tests.
